# Regional-Wall-Motion-Abnormality-Detection
The echocardiogram is an ultrasound imaging modality,employed to assess cardiac abnormalities. 
The Regional Wall MotionAbnormality (RWMA) is the occurrence of abnormal or absent contractility of a region of the heart muscle. 
Conventional assessment of RWMA is based on visual interpretation of endocardial excursion andmyocardial thickening from the echocardiogram videos.
We developed a novel deep learning architecture EC3D-Net (Echo-Cardio 3D Net), which captures the temporal informationfor identifying regional wall motion abnormality from Echocardiogram
EC3D-Net achieves both an overall F1-Score and an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.82.
