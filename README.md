# Regional-Wall-Motion-Abnormality-Detection
The echocardiogram is an ultrasound imaging modality,employed to assess cardiac abnormalities. 
The Regional Wall Motion Abnormality (RWMA) is the occurrence of abnormal or absent contractility of a region of the heart muscle. 
Conventional assessment of RWMA is based on visual interpretation from the echocardiogram videos.
We developed a novel deep learning architecture EC3D-Net (Echo-Cardio 3D Net), which captures the temporal information for identifying regional wall motion abnormality from Echocardiogram.
EC3D-Net achieves both an overall F1-Score and an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.82.
This study used the HMC-QU dataset. Original dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aysendegerli/hmcqu-dataset
